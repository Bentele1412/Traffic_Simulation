# Ideas for autonomous controller
* SOTL + self-adapting threshold:
  * calculate traffic density at runtime to determine threshold value and green phase times 
  * $\theta$ = k * trafficDensity --> "optimize" k to control the impact of $\theta$-change


## Open Questions
* definition of traffic density
* number of traffic density calculations
