    Adaptive threshold self-organizing traffic light controller

    Problem of basic SOTL:
        - Green phases get shorter if traffic load gets heavier but should get longer
        - leads to more yellow phases and crossing clearing --> less time for queue clearing --> lost time for every crossway participant to move on

    Idea:
        - adaptive threshold of integrated cars on lane
        - the more cars driving to a red light of the crossway per lane, the bigger the threshold gets (biggest threshold for all (red) lanes at the crossway)

    Implementation strategy:
        - sum up all cars driving towards crossway and multiply with a constant (constant to be optimized)
        --> threshold =  avgCarsTowardsCrossway**self.beta * self.alpha
        - alpha 
            - constant to adapt threshold to needed scale range
        - beta 
            - exponent to ensure increasing threshold of running averaged cars towards crossway
            - otherwise kappa overshooting theta would need always the same time (linear dependency of carsTowardsCrossway and alpha)

    Open Questions: 
        - Adaptation strength
