    General Notes:

        Parameters:
        -----------
        trafficLightId: str
            Net id of corresponding traffic light.
        lanes: list
            List of incoming lane ids connected to traffic light.
            sorted --> [lane from north, lane from west]
        detectors: list
            List of detectors placed on incoming lanes of traffic light.
            sorted --> [lane from north, lane from west]
        minGreenTime: float
            Minimum green time for each green phase in seconds.
        maxGreenTime: float
            Maximum green time for each green phase in seconds.

        Returns:
        --------
        None.
